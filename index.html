        Our goal is to create a mobile application that allows collectors to
        make a catalog from all of their unique items. This app will allow users
        to easily add photos and descriptions of their stock into one,
        easy-to-use exhaustive digital catalog. Since many collectors have more
        than one type of collection, we will allow users to have multiple
        catalog groups within the app. For example, a user could have separate
        catalogs for a coin collection and for a baseball card collection. This
        allows users to keep track of all their collections in the same place!
