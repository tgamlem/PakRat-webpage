          Users will be able to easily create a new Pak, fill out a form
          for each of their items, snap a quick picture, and view everything within their collection.
          More popular Paks such as movies, coins, and books will have specialized
          forms, but if your Pak is a unique niche, you can also customize your own form!
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            For those who like to share their Pak with others, Pakrat will have a 
            'Loan' feature that will allow users to track which items are on loan,
            who they loaned it to, and how long it's been out.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">
            Collectors know that their Pak can never truly be complete. That's why
            PakRat will offer a 'Wishlist' to allow users to catalog items that they'd 
            like to one day get ahold of. This Wishlist can be easily shared with others,
            so the whole world can know about the perfect thing to buy for a fellow Pakrat.
